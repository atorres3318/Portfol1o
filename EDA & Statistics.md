### Hypotheses Evaluations
***

There are three hypotheses:
1.  "there will be an N400 in the quiet condition, with violation sentences eliciting more negative ERPs than control sentences between 400-600 ms"
2.  "there will also be an N400 in the noise condition, with violation sentences eliciting more negative ERPs than control sentences between 400-600 ms"
3.  "the N400 in response to violations will be significantly smaller in the noise than quiet conditions, because more cognitive effort will be directed to filtering out noise, leaving fewer resources to process the semantic anomaly"
***

#### Hypothesis 1 & 2 - True

In both quiet and noisy groups, we observed a **more negative amplitude in the violation** condition:

###### An ERP waveform of the N400 in each condition showed:

    - When looking at the time frame .4s - .6s, we see that the orange line representing the quiet/violation condition is lower than the blue line showing the quiet/control condition. A lower height means a more negative amplitude
        -the quiet/violation condition is more negative than the quiet control
    - Similarly, we see the red line showing quiet/violation is lower than the green line showing the noisy/control condition. A lower height means a more negative amplitude
        -the noisy/violation is more negative than the noisy/control

###### Topographic maps of each condition showed:

    - Darker shades of blue indicate more negative amplitudes. We see a darker shade of blue for the violation conditions in both quiet and noisy groups.

#### Hypothesis 3 - False

There was a difference between the noise/violation and quiet/violation conditions, but they were **not statistically different.**

###### Boxplots of the mean differences showed:

    - Upon first inspection there appears to be a difference between two. The orange boxplot representing violation appears lower / more  negative.

###### Performing a t-test revealed:

    - The p-value is greater than alpha 0.05; therefore, we conclude there is no statistical difference between the noise and quiet conditions in the violation group!
